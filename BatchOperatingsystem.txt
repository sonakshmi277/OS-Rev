A Batch Operating System is one of the earliest types of operating systems where similar jobs are grouped together and executed sequentially without user interaction. 
In this system, the user prepares jobs with instructions, submits them to the computer operator, and the OS executes them in batches. 
This eliminates the need for manual intervention during execution and improves overall system utilization compared to manual job processing.

Advantages:

Increases throughput since jobs are processed in groups.
Reduces idle time of CPU as the next job is automatically loaded once one finishes.
Best suited for large jobs requiring similar types of processing.

Disadvantages:

No direct interaction between user and computer during execution, leading to delays in debugging.
Difficult to prioritize tasks, so urgent jobs cannot be executed immediately.
Turnaround time can be high because jobs must wait for the entire batch to complete.
