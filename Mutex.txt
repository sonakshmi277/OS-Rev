Mutex: A mutex (short for mutual exclusion) is a synchronization primitive used to ensure that only 
    one thread or process can access a critical section or shared resource at a time. 
       It acts like a lock: when a thread wants to enter the critical section, it must acquire (lock) the mutex. 
       If the mutex is already locked by another thread, the current thread must wait (block) until it becomes available. 
       Once the thread finishes its task in the critical section, it releases (unlocks) the mutex 
       so that other threads can proceed.
