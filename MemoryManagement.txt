Memory management can be done in two ways: fixed-size partitioning and variable-size partitioning. In fixed-size partitioning, memory is divided 
into blocks of fixed size, and processes are allocated to these blocks if available. In variable-size partitioning, memory is not pre-divided; instead, 
there are holes, which are parts of memory left free by terminated processes or unused areas. These holes are of variable size. The operating system maintains 
a free list of these holes, and when a process arrives, it allocates memory to the process according to its size from one of these holes. The OS can choose 
which hole to allocate using four strategies: First Fit, Next Fit, Best Fit, and Worst Fit. In First Fit, the OS allocates the first hole in the list that is 
large enough, which is simple and fast but may leave small unusable fragments early in memory. Next Fit is similar to First Fit but starts searching from 
where the last allocation ended, spreading allocation more evenly. Best Fit allocates the smallest hole that is big enough, reducing wasted space but taking 
longer to search. Worst Fit allocates the largest available hole, leaving bigger leftover holes for future allocations.
