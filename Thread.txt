A thread is the smallest unit of execution within a process. While a process is an independent 
program with its own memory space, threads share the same process resources like code, data, and 
files but have their own program counter, stack, and registers. Threads allow a process to perform multiple tasks 
concurrently, improving CPU utilization and application responsiveness. For example, in a web browser, one thread 
may handle user input while another downloads data in the background.
