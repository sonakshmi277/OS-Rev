A Multiprocessing Operating System is one that supports the use of two or more processors (CPUs) within a single computer system. 
In this OS, tasks are divided among multiple processors that work in parallel, 
which significantly improves the system’s performance, speed, and reliability. 
Each processor can execute different instructions independently, or they can work together on a single task to reduce execution time.

Advantages:

High performance due to parallel execution of tasks.
Better reliability—if one processor fails, others can still continue.
Increased throughput since multiple processes are executed simultaneously.
Efficient resource utilization as processors are not left idle.

Disadvantages:

High cost due to the need for multiple CPUs and supporting hardware.
Complex design for communication and synchronization between processors.
OS complexity—requires advanced scheduling and resource management.
Not all tasks can be efficiently parallelized, limiting performance gain.
