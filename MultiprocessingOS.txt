A Multiprocessing Operating System is one that supports the use of two or more processors (CPUs) within a single computer system. 
In this OS, tasks are divided among multiple processors that work in parallel, 
which significantly improves the systemâ€™s performance, speed, and reliability. 
Each processor can execute different instructions independently, or they can work together on a single task to reduce execution time.
