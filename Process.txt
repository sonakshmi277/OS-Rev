There are two types of processes:
    Single-threaded processes
        Contain only one thread of execution.
        They have one program counter (PC), one stack, and one set of registers.
        At any given time, the process can do only one task.
        Example: A simple text editor that only edits files sequentially.

    Multi-threaded processes

        Contain multiple threads within the same process.
        All threads share the same code, data, and resources, but each thread has its own PC, registers, and stack.
        This allows tasks to run concurrently (like handling user input, background saving, and spell check simultaneously).
        Example: A modern web browser where different threads handle UI, rendering, and network requests.
