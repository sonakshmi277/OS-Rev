Process scheduling is the activity performed by the operating system to decide which process will execute on the CPU next. Since there are 
multiple processes competing for limited CPU cores, scheduling ensures fairness, reduces waiting time, and improves overall system utilization 
and performance. Scheduling is broadly categorized into three types: long-term scheduling, which decides which processes are admitted into the 
system for execution; medium-term scheduling, which suspends or resumes processes to improve CPU and memory utilization; and short-term scheduling, 
where the CPU scheduler decides which process runs next on the CPU. The short-term scheduler uses various algorithms like Shortest Job First (SJF), 
Round Robin, Priority Scheduling, and Multilevel Queue Scheduling to achieve efficiency.
