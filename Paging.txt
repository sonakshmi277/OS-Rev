Paging is a memory management scheme in operating systems that allows a computer to store and retrieve data from physical memory (RAM) 
in fixed-size blocks called pages, 
instead of requiring contiguous memory space for processes. It helps to avoid problems like external fragmentation and makes memory 
allocation more flexible.

How Paging Works

CPU generates a logical address (also called virtual address) consisting of:
    Page number (p) → which page in the process
    Offset (d) → location within that page

    The Page Table maps the page number to a frame number in physical memory.

    Physical address = Frame number + Offset

    Data is accessed from the corresponding frame in RAM.
