Paging is a memory management technique that solves the problem of external fragmentation by removing the requirement of contiguous physical 
memory allocation. Instead of allocating memory as one continuous block, a process’s logical address space is divided into fixed-size pages, 
while physical memory is divided into frames of the same size. These pages can be stored in any available frames in RAM, allowing non-contiguous
memory allocation. When a program executes, the CPU generates a logical (virtual) address consisting of a page number and an offset. 
The page number is used to index into the page table, which maps each page to its corresponding frame in physical memory, while the offset 
specifies the exact location within that frame. The Memory Management Unit (MMU) performs this address translation in hardware, forming the
physical address used to access data from RAM. Paging also enables virtual memory by allowing only the required pages of a process to reside 
in RAM, while the remaining pages are stored on disk due to limited RAM capacity. If the CPU accesses a page that is not present in RAM,
a page fault occurs, and the operating system fetches the required page from disk, updates the page table, and resumes execution.
