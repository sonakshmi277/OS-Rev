Threads in operating systems are primarily of two types: user-level threads (ULT) and kernel-level threads (KLT). 
User-level threads are managed by a user-level thread library, so the kernel is unaware of them. 
They are fast to create and manage but can block the entire process if one thread performs a blocking system call. 
Kernel-level threads, on the other hand, are managed directly by the OS kernel. 
They are slower to create and manage due to system overhead but are more powerful, as the OS can schedule them 
independently on multiple processors, and a blocking system call by one thread does not block other threads in 
the same process. Some systems also implement hybrid threading, combining the advantages of both.
