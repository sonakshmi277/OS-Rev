A Process Control Block (PCB) is a data structure used by the operating system to manage processes. It contains essential information such 
as the Process ID (unique identifier), process state (running, ready, or waiting), program counter (the address of the next instruction), 
CPU registers and related execution data, memory management details, and I/O information like open files or devices. These components allow 
the OS to track, schedule, and control processes effectively, especially during context switching
