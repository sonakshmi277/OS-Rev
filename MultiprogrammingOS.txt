Multiprogramming is a technique where multiple programs are kept in memory at the same time so that the CPU always has a job to execute. 
When one program is waiting for I/O, the CPU can switch to another program, thereby improving CPU utilization. 

On the other hand, multiprocessing refers to the use of two or more processors within a single system to execute multiple processes 
simultaneously. A multiprocessing operating system coordinates these processors, distributes tasks among them, and manages synchronization.

In short, multiprogramming improves CPU utilization by switching among programs on a single processor, while multiprocessing achieves 
actual parallel execution using multiple processors.
