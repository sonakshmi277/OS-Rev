A Time Sharing Operating System allows multiple users to share system resources simultaneously. 
It uses the concept of time slices, where CPU time is divided into small units and allocated to each user or process in a round-robin or priority-based manner. 
This creates the illusion that each user has their own dedicated system, while in reality, the CPU rapidly switches between tasks. 
Time sharing OS was designed to provide interactive computing and reduce response time.

Advantages:

Efficient resource utilization since multiple users share the same system.
Quick response time for users, enabling interactive computing.
Reduces idle time of CPU and other resources.
Fair allocation of resources among multiple users.

Disadvantages:

Complexity in scheduling and managing multiple users.
Security and privacy risks since data is shared across users.
Reliability issuesâ€”if one task crashes, it may affect others.
High overhead due to frequent switching of tasks (context switching).
