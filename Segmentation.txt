Segmentation is a memory management technique in which a program is divided into logical segments such as code, data, stack, and 
functions, each of variable size. A logical address is represented as a pair ⟨segment number, offset⟩. The segment number identifies 
which segment the address belongs to and is used to index the segment table, which stores the base address (starting physical address 
of the segment) and limit (size of the segment). The offset specifies the exact location within the segment and is added to the base to 
obtain the physical address. The limit ensures memory access stays within bounds, preventing illegal access. Segmentation reflects the logical 
structure of a program, allows easier sharing and protection of memory, but can lead to external fragmentation. It differs from paging, which 
uses fixed-size blocks and does not correspond to the program’s logical divisions.
