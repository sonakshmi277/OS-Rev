A Distributed Operating System is an operating system that manages a collection of independent, networked computers and makes them appear to the 
users as a single coherent system. Unlike a clustered OS, where nodes are tightly coupled and physically close, a distributed OS works in a loosely 
coupled environment, typically spread over a network. It provides a single system image by transparently handling process scheduling, resource management, 
and communication across multiple machines. Users and applications interact with the distributed system as if it were one computer, even though the resources 
are physically located on different nodes. The main goals of a distributed OS are transparency, scalability, and fault tolerance, ensuring efficient resource 
utilization and seamless user experience across geographically dispersed systems.
