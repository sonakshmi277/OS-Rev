A Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) is an operating system designed to process data and respond to inputs within a strict, 
predefined time constraint. 
It is used in systems where timely execution is critical, such as embedded systems, robotics, medical devices, and industrial control systems. 

RTOS focuses on predictability and reliability rather than just throughput.

There are two types:

Hard real-time OS: Missing a deadline is unacceptable (e.g., pacemakers, airbag systems).
Soft real-time OS: Occasional deadline misses are tolerable but performance should be consistent (e.g., video streaming, online games).
