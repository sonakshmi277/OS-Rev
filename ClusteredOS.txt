A clustered operating system is when two or more computers (nodes) are connected and work together, typically for high availability 
and performance.

Each node in the cluster runs its own operating system, but clustering software coordinates them.

The cluster may share storage, and if one node fails, another node takes over (failover).

Transparency is less complete than in a true distributed OS â€” the user may still know which server they are connected to.
