A Clustered Operating System is a type of operating system designed to manage and coordinate a group of independent computers, called nodes, 
so that they function together as a single unified system. Each node in the cluster has its own hardware and local operating system, but the 
clustered OS provides a higher-level management layer that ensures resource sharing, load balancing, and fault tolerance across the entire cluster. 
From the userâ€™s perspective, the cluster appears as one single system, even though it is composed of multiple machines. This design improves 
performance, enhances availability, and provides reliability, as if one node fails, others can take over its tasks seamlessly.
