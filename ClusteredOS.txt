A Clustered System is a type of computer system where two or more independent computers (nodes) are connected and work together as a single system. 
The operating system manages the cluster so that users experience it as one unit. 
Clustered systems are mainly used for high availability, load balancing, and parallel processing. 
If one node fails, others can take over, ensuring reliability and fault tolerance.



Clustered System

A clustered system is basically multiple computers (nodes) connected and working together as if they are one.
The main goal is high availability and reliability—so if one machine fails, another takes over.
Typically used in servers, banking systems, hospital systems, where downtime cannot be tolerated.
Example: A web server cluster where if one server goes down, another continues serving requests.

Distributed System

A distributed system is where multiple computers are connected via a network, and the OS manages them so users see it as a single system.
The main goal is resource sharing, scalability, and parallel computation.
Used in cloud computing, grid computing, big data systems.
Example: Google Search or Hadoop cluster—tasks are split across many machines to finish faster.
